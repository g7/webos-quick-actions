===================

webOS Quick Actions takes your Just Type experience to a next level!
Create shortcuts to easily launch your favorite applications, or make the browser launch your favorite site and modify its behaviour
using only the Just Type input box!
It's easier to do than to explain :)
If you are familiar with shell scripting on Unix machines, you will be at home. If you are not, just read the in-app Help :)

Just an example: you can create an action for searching in google.
Let's say we name this action 'google'. We can search by writing "google the things I should find" on the Just Type box,
and then pressing the "Execute Quick Action" button (you NEED to add webOS Quick Actions items on the Just Type preferences, see the Help).
But this does not only apply to google, but for whatever website you want (which can do searches from the URL).

For example? You can add support for the Italian white pages, which do not have an official application for webOS.
The created actions are saved to your Palm Profile.
